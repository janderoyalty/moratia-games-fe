					Moratia is a fantasy world created and developed by Thomas Royalty as
					a host for various games and stories. This envisioned reality is
					rooted in a special essence known as trabia. Trabia permeates
					everything, and when mastered can be manipulated to nearly limitless
					skills and techniques. The planet’s rich history spreads across nearly
					twenty thousand years and includes civilizations that advance and
					decline. Through the eras of this world, one can find a range of
					civilizations and societies ranging from the most simplistic to most
					advanced in both technology and trabiatic techniques. In it’s first
					iteration, the Era of Barrier Fall, the world is at a crossroads where
					trabia and trabiatic techniques are being rediscovered after hundreds
					of years of its rejection and loss to eras past. This reemergence of
					trabiatic knowledge is put to use in amplifying, advancing and merging
					with technology to astounding results. In this world, the times of
					legendary mages past and mechanical advancements present collide into
					a volatile mix, thrusting individuals and governments into conflict as
					competition for control of this advancement lies within reach of every
					man. In this world, you will find your adventure before you. In this
					world lies your own chance to become a legend remembered through the
					ages.
