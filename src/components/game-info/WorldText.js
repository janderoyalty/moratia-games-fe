          Moratia is a fantasy world created and developed by Thomas Royalty as
          a host for various games and stories. This envisioned reality is
          rooted in a special essence known as trabia. Trabia permeates
          everything, and when mastered can be manipulated to nearly limitless
          skills and techniques. The planet’s rich history spreads across nearly
          twenty thousand years and includes civilizations that advance and
          decline. Through the eras of this world, one can find a range of
          civilizations and societies ranging from the most simplistic to most
          advanced in both technology and trabiatic techniques. In it’s first
          iteration, the Era of Barrier Fall, the world is at a crossroads where
          trabia and trabiatic techniques are being rediscovered after hundreds
          of years of its rejection and loss to eras past. This reemergence of
          trabiatic knowledge is put to use in amplifying, advancing and merging
          with technology to astounding results. In this world, the times of
          legendary mages past and mechanical advancements present collide into
          a volatile mix, thrusting individuals and governments into conflict as
          competition for control of this advancement lies within reach of every
          man. In this world, you will find your adventure before you. In this
          world lies your own chance to become a legend remembered through the
          ages.
